Invariant Testing Suite

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive invariant testing suite for the **Hawk High School** smart contract system. The `Properties.sol` contract implements 9 critical invariants to ensure the system behaves correctly under all conditions during fuzzing campaigns.

## 🎯 Purpose

This invariant test suite is designed to:
- Validate core business logic of the Hawk High School system
- Identify edge cases and vulnerabilities through property-based testing
- Ensure system integrity across all possible state transitions
- Provide comprehensive coverage for audit and security review

## 📋 Invariants Overview

### ✅ Working Invariants

| ID | Property | Description | Status |
|----|----------|-------------|--------|
| 3 | `invariant_studentScoresBounded` | Student scores must not exceed 100 | ✅ PASSING |
| 4 | `invariant_reviewCountWithinLimits` | Review count cannot exceed 5 | ✅ PASSING |
| 5 | `invariant_sessionStateLogic` | Session end must be set when in session | ✅ PASSING |
| 8 | `invariant_paymentDistribution` | Total wages cannot exceed 100% | ✅ PASSING |

### 🔴 Failing Invariants (Potential Bugs)

| ID | Property | Description | Status | Impact |
|----|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `invariant_reviewCountIncreasesAfterPositiveReview` | Review count must increase after positive reviews | 🔴 BROKEN | High |
| 2 | `invariant_principalCannotBeTeacher` | Principal should not have teacher privileges | 🔴 BROKEN | Medium |
| 6 | `invariant_bursaryAccumulation` | Bursary should equal total fees paid | 🔴 BROKEN | Critical |
| 7 | `invariant_contractBalanceConsistency` | Contract balance ≥ bursary amount | 🔴 BROKEN | Critical |
| 9 | `invariant_noDoubleSpending` | Prevents over-distribution of funds | 🔴 BROKEN | Critical |

## 🔍 Detailed Invariant Analysis

### Property 1: Review Count Logic
```solidity
function invariant_reviewCountIncreasesAfterPositiveReview(address _student) external
```
**Expected Behavior**: When a positive review is given, the student's review count should increment.
**Potential Issue**: Review counting mechanism may be faulty or conditional logic may be incorrect.

### Property 2: Role Separation
```solidity
function invariant_principalCannotBeTeacher() public
```
**Expected Behavior**: The principal should not have teacher role permissions.
**Potential Issue**: Role management system may allow privilege overlap.

### Properties 6, 7, 9: Financial Integrity
These three properties focus on the critical financial aspects of the system:
- **Property 6**: Ensures all paid fees are properly tracked in the bursary
- **Property 7**: Verifies contract holds sufficient tokens to cover obligations
- **Property 9**: Prevents over-distribution during graduation payouts

**Critical Impact**: These failures suggest potential fund drainage or accounting inconsistencies.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Properties.sol
├── extends Handler (LevelOneHandlers.sol)
├── extends PropertiesAsserts (assertion utilities)
└── tests LevelOne.sol contract
```

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 9 invariants covering business logic, access control, and financial integrity
- **State-based Testing**: Properties validate state consistency across all operations
- **Financial Security**: Multiple properties ensure funds are properly managed and distributed
- **Role-based Access**: Validates separation of concerns between actors

### Testing Methodology
- Uses Foundry's invariant testing framework
- Handler-based approach for controlled state transitions
- Property assertions with detailed error messages
- Systematic coverage of all contract functions

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Invariant Tests
```bash
 medusa fuzz
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Handler Setup
The contract inherits from `Handler` which provides:
- Controlled function calls to the target contract
- Proper state management
- Random parameter generation for fuzzing

### Assertion Framework
Uses `PropertiesAsserts` for:
- Enhanced assertion messages
- Consistent error reporting
- Debugging utilities

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### For Successful Properties
When invariants pass, they validate:
- Correct implementation of business rules
- Proper state transitions
- Security of access controls

### For Failing Properties
Failing invariants indicate:
- **Critical Bugs**: Properties 6, 7, 9 suggest fund management issues
- **Logic Errors**: Properties 1, 2 indicate implementation flaws
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Role confusion and state inconsistencies

## 🎯 Audit Focus Areas

Based on the failing invariants, auditors should focus on:

1. **Fund Management** (Properties 6, 7, 9)
   - Bursary calculation logic
   - Token transfer mechanisms
   - Distribution calculations in `graduateAndUpgrade()`

2. **Review System** (Property 1)
   - Review counting implementation
   - Conditional logic for positive vs negative reviews

3. **Access Control** (Property 2)
   - Role assignment mechanisms
   - Permission validation functions

## 📝 Notes for Security Review

- This test suite identifies 5 potential vulnerabilities in the Hawk High system
- Financial properties are most critical - fund drainage potential exists
- Role separation issues could lead to privilege escalation
- All failing properties should be investigated during manual review

## 🔄 Continuous Testing

This invariant suite should be run:
- During development iterations
- Before deployment
- As part of CI/CD pipeline
- During security audits

**Disclaimer**: This is a security testing suite. Failing invariants indicate potential vulnerabilities that require immediate investigation and remediation.
